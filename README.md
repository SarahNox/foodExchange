This repo shall display a small food sharing app which shall help to provide food for free to the people who need it. The intent is to provide and give spare food away instead of wasting it. Therefore the goal is to save money, avoid waste and maybe even get to know your neighbors.

## Motivation

We had a week with some stress and arguments but still fun about trying to finish this project.

## Installation

* npm install...
* look at the package.json

## Implementation

We implemented the solution on a Javascript basis as suggested.

## Challenge to be solved


* Have at least 3 models (more if they make sense) â€“ one representing a User of your application, and two that represents the main functional idea for your app. Models should be related to each other.
* Include sign-up / sign-in / sign-out functionality, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow.
* Have complete RESTful routes for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.
* Utilize Mongoose to create your models and add the proper validations.
* Include wireframes that you designed during the planning process.
* Have a Responsive Design, we recommend you start mobile-first and then build up for larger screen sizes!
* Have semantically clean HTML and CSS.
* Be deployed online and accessible to the public.


## Problems / Mistakes

My Git commits were not small and descriptive. I have to work on that as it will be difficult to fix now. Before adding anything now I have to pay more attention on that topic.
